# Statistical-Rethinking-Notes
Selected chapters and replication from Richard McElreath's book "Statistical Rethinking"

Here I review and appreciate the author's work, and add some of my own insights.


## Waffles and Divorce R file 
Here I use a simple multivariate model to disprove the theory that the number of waffle houses in a state has any meaningful impact on that state's divorce rate. It is more a feature of the younge marriage age in southern states. Marriage rate could also be considered a factor, but I show with models and two different types of plots, predictor residuals plots and counterfactual plots, that marriage age is chiefly responsible.
